  "description": "Simplefog allows you to draw fog of war manually, optionally automatically hiding and revealing tokens underneath based on opacity. It provides a number of tools to quickly draw and erase fog in various shapes - brush, rectangles, ellipses, polygons or to reveal tiles you click/drag on the grid. The fog opacity and color can be adjusted (for both GM and player) and you can animate the transition, allowing for effects like Fade to Black.",
